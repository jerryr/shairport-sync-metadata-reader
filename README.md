# shairport-sync-metadata-reader
Shairport Sync Metadata on lcdproc

This program reads the pipe of metadata optionally generated by Shairport Sync 2.4 and later, and sends the decoded data to an lcdproc server for display on an LCD screen. Shairport Sync is an AirTunes emulator with audio synchronization and multi-room capability -- https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync. To use shairport-sync-metadata-reader, read the pipe via standard input, e.g.

```
shairport-sync-metadata-reader < /tmp/shairport-sync-metadata
```

All of the metadata-decoding code is forked from Mike Brady's sample here: https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync-metadata-reader
